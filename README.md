# frappe_docker
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/frappe/frappe_docker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/frappe/frappe_docker)

- [Docker](https://docker.com/) is an open source project to pack, ship and run any Linux application in a lighter weight, faster container than a traditional virtual machine.

- Docker makes it much easier to deploy [frappe](https://github.com/frappe/frappe) on your servers.

- This container uses [bench](https://github.com/frappe/bench) to install frappe.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/)

### Container Configuration

#### ports:

```
ports:
      - "3307:3307"   mariadb-port
      - "8000:8000"   webserver-port
      - "11000:11000" redis-cache
      - "12000:12000" redis-queue
      - "13000:13000" redis-socketio
      - "9000:9000"   socketio-port
      - "6787:6787"   file-watcher-port
```

Expose port 3307 inside the container on port 3307 on ALL local host interfaces. In order to bind to only one interface, you may specify the host's IP address as `([<host_interface>:[host_port]])|(<host_port>):<container_port>[/udp]` as defined in the [docker port binding documentation](http://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockerlinks/). The port 3307 of the mariadb container and port 8000 of the frappe container is exposed to the host machine and other containers.

#### volumes:

```
volumes:
     - ./frappe-bench:/home/frappe/frappe-bench
     - ./conf/mariadb-conf.d:/etc/mysql/conf.d
     - ./redis-conf/redis_socketio.conf:/etc/conf.d/redis.conf
     - ./redis-conf/redis_queue.conf:/etc/conf.d/redis.conf
     - ./redis-conf/redis_cache.conf:/etc/conf.d/redis.conf
```
Exposes a directory inside the host to the container.

#### links:

```
links:
      - redis-cache
      - redis-queue
      - redis-socketio
      - mariadb
```

Links allow you to define extra aliases by which a service is reachable from another service.

#### depends_on:

```
depends_on:
      - mariadb
      - redis-cache
      - redis-queue
      - redis-socketio
```
Express dependency between services, which has two effects:

1. docker-compose up will start services in dependency order. In the following example, mariadb and redis will be started before frappe.

2. docker-compose up SERVICE will automatically include SERVICEâ€™s dependencies. In the following example, docker-compose up docker_frappe will also create and start mariadb and redis.

### Installation

#### 1. Installation Pre-requisites

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation) Community Edition

- Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (only for Linux users). Docker for Mac, Docker for Windows, and Docker Toolbox include Docker Compose

#### 2. Build the container and install bench

* Clone this repo and change your working directory to frappe_docker
	
		git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/frappe/frappe_docker.git
		cd frappe_docker

* Build the container and install bench inside the container.

	1.Build the 5 linked containers frappe, mariadb, redis-cache, redis-queue and redis-socketio using this command. 	 Make sure your current working directory is frappe_docker which contains the docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile.
	It creates a user, frappe inside the frappe container, whose working directory is /home/frappe. It also clones
	the bench-repo from [here](https://github.com/frappe/bench)

		docker-compose up -d

	Note: Please do not remove the bench-repo directory the above commands will create



#### Basic Usage
##### Make sure your current directory is frappe_docker
1.	First time setup 
 
		./dbench init

2.	Command to start all the containers

		docker-compose start

3.	Command to be executed everytime after starting your containers

		./dbench -s

4.	Command to enter your container  

		docker exec -it frappe bash 

5.	All bench commands can also be directly run from the host machine by using dbench. For instance ```bench start``` can be executed by running ```./dbench -c start```. Just preface the option with <b>./dbench -c</b>. For more information on dbench run the command ```./dbench -h```.

To login to Frappe / ERPNext, open your browser and go to `[your-external-ip]:8000`, probably `localhost:8000`

The default username is "Administrator" and password is what you set when you created the new site.
